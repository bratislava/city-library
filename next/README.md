This readme should get you up & running. For more detailed documentation, check the /docs file in the root of the repo.

## First-time setup

You need `node` and `yarn` installed locally.

To install dependencies run:

```
yarn
```

For CMS setup see `strapi` directory. Presently you can run this against v3 strapi, either local one or the on running at `https://strapi-city-library.bratislava.sk`

## Run project locally

```
yarn dev
```

## Generate GraphQL

Strapi V4 does not export schema.graphql by default - instead, you'll need a running server to generate types from graphql endpoint. Otherwise the process is the same

```bash
# to update queries or mutations, modify *.graphql files in /graphql/queries directory
# have the strapi server running locally on port 1337 and run the following
yarn gen
```
